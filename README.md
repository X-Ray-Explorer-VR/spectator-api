Spectator API is a REST API developed using Python that allows the spectator frontend get all the bone related information from a database.

## Running the app using super container

If you want to run the REST API and all the releated functionality we recommend use the Docker Compose file that you can find here: [X-Ray-Explorer-VR/super-container](https://github.com/X-Ray-Explorer-VR/super-container)

It contains all the needed dependencies, including a MariaDB instance and a copy of the database, to run all the project services (excluding the VR application).
